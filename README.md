# libaoc - Advent of Code code
Bart Massey

This Rust library crate is a bunch of
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) specific machinery
and random useful utilities. It has `rustdoc` if you are
interested. There's some useful stuff for competitive
programming in general, as well as some stuff that always
comes up in AoC.
